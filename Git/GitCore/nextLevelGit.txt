Next Level Git - From Diffing to Undoing Changes

##### Introducing the Git Diff Command #####
    - use the git diff command to view changes between commits, branches, files, our working direcctory, and more.
    - we often use git diff alongside commands like git status and git log, to get a better picture of a repository and how it has changed over time.
    
    > git diff => list all the changes in our working directory that are NOT staged for the next commit

    - for a better understanding of reading diff, watch section 8, video 3 for a complete and through explanation

##### Viewing Unstaged Changes #####
    > git diff => compares staging area and working directory
    > git diff HEAD => lists all changes in the working tree since your last commit
    > git diff --stage OR git diff --cached => list the changes between the staging area and out last commit (show me what will be included in my commit if I run git commit right now)

##### Diffing Specific Files #####
    > git diff HEAD <filename> => list all changes, staged or unstaged since the last commit in that file
    > git diff --staged <filename> => list all changes in that file that is staged 

##### Comparing Changes Across Branches #####
    > git diff branch1..branch2 

##### Comparing Changes Across Commits #####
    > git diff commit1..commit2
