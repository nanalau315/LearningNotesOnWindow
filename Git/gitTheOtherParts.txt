Git: The Other Parts - From Rebasing to Custom Aliases and More

##### Rebasing #####
    - why rebase? we get a much cleaner project history. no unnecessary merge commits! We end up with a linear project history.
    - never rebase commits that have been shared with others. If you have already pushed commits up to Github, DO NOT rebase them unless you are positive no one on the team is using those commits.
    - !!! You do not want to rewrite any git history that other people already have. Its a pain to reconcile the alternate histories.
    - there are two main ways to use the git rebase command:
        - as an alternative to merging
            - by rebasing, it can move the entire feature branch so that it begins at the tip of the master branch. All of the work is still there, but we have re-written history. so instead of using a merge commit, rebasing rewrites history by creating new commits for each of the original feature branch commits
            - first run 
                > git switch <branch-name>
            - then run 
                > git rebase master
        - as a cleanup tool
